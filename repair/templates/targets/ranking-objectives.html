        <p> Below you find a list of objectives defined in the plenary discussion (see <i>Status Quo > Objectives</i>). </p>
        <p>
            Try to find an agreement on their relative importance within your small group.
            Move the objectives by dragging and dropping them inside the list so that their order reflects your ranking:
            The objective most important to you should be on top. The least important at the bottom.
